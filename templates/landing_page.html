            <h2>What Are 'Show Me, Tell Me' Questions?</h2>
            <p>Candidates must answer two vehicle safety questions during their driving test, covering basic maintenance and operation procedures for the vehicle being used. You may be asked to open the bonnet to identify fluid reservoirs and explain how you would check fluid levels. Your trainer will advise that you wonâ€™t be required to touch a hot engine or physically check fluid levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Wear disposable gloves for under-bonnet checks and a high-visibility vest when making safety checks on the public highway.</p>
