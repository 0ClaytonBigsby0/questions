    <h1>Detailed Test Overview</h1>
    <p>The driving test in the UK consists of several parts designed to asses your driving skills and knowledge. Here's what you can expect: </p>

    <h2>1. Eye Test</h2>
    <p>Before the practical driving test starts, you'll be asked to read a number plate from a distance of 20 metres (for vehicle with a new-style number plate) or 20.5 metres (for a vehicle with an old-style number plate).</p>

    <h2>2. Vehicle Safety Questions</h2>
    <p>This section includes the "Show me, Tell me" questions. You will be asked one 'tell me' question at the beginning of your test, before you start driving, and one 'show me' question while you're driving.</p>

    <h2>3. General Driving Ability</h2>
    <p>You'll be assessed on your general driving ability, including starting and stopping the car, observing and following road signs, and handling various road conditions and traffic.</p>

    <h2>4. Reversing Exercises</h2>
    <p>You will be asked to perform one of the following reversing exercises: parallel park at the side of the road, park in a parking bay, or reverse around a corner.</p>

    <h2>5. Independent Driving</h2>
    <p>For about 20 minutes, you will be asked to drive independently by either following directions from a sat nav or following traffic signs.</p>

    <h2>6. Highway Code and Traffic Signs</h2>
    <p>Your knowledge of the Highway Code and traffic signs will be assessed throughout the test. Ensure you're familiar with all the rules and signs.</p>

    <h2>7. Test Results</h2>
    <p>At the end of the test, the examiner will tell you if you passed or failed. If you pass, you'll get a pass certificate. If you fail, the examiner will explain why and you can book another test.</p>
